### Prerequisites (Work in progress):
- You will need to install [node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [steam-user](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-user) (npm i steam-user)
- [steam-totp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-totp) (npm i steam-totp)
- [steam-tradeoffer-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-tradeoffer-manager) (npm i steam-tradeoffer-manager)
- [steam-community](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steamcommunity) (npm i steamcommunity)

### Steps to get bot working:
1. Fill out config file with username, password, [sharedSecret](https://gist.github.com/mathielo/8367e464baa73941a075bae4dd5eed90), idSecret, and [apiKey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
2. (NOT REQUIRED) In addition to this, edit the DonationBot.js file, on line 51 there is a section where you need to add a trusted accounts Steam64 ID so that the bot will autoaccept trades that are received from that account. If you do not fill this out then it will still work, you just won't have an administrator account to remotely control the bot. 
3. As long as the packages above are installed, you can run the bot by opening cmd, navigating to the correct directory, and using "node DonationBot.js"
4. It will display the login process in your console. If you get any errors it should print them so that they can be fixed.
